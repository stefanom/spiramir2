 # SpiraMir 2
 
 This folder contains a Blender add-on to draw or fill curves with recursive
 non-interative logarithmic spirals.
 
 ## TODO

 *  speed up iterative growth
    * avoid testing points on curves that can never intersect (wrong side of tangent, non-overlapping bounding boxes)
 *  make sure sprues still work
 *  see if spiramir and circles work together well
 *  test on the various expected containment shapes
